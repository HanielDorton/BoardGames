Daniel Boardgames
=============================

I created this clean website in order to learn and test out different Javascript libraries including Node.js, Backbone.js, and Bootstrap. It is a very simply bootstrap themed site in which you can view my boardgame collection. The collection is filterable by both number of players and average game-time.
